#🥁 Drum Kit Project  

This is a simple and interactive Drum Kit Web App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's designed for beginners to learn how to use event listeners and audio in the browser. Each button represents a drum sound, and when clicked or a key is pressed, it plays a unique sound — just like a real drum set!

🕹️ User Interaction 

The app displays seven drum buttons: w, a, s, d, j, k, l.  
When a user clicks any of the buttons or presses the keys, a corresponding drum sound is played.  
This project demonstrates how JavaScript can control the DOM and trigger audio playback based on user actions.

🌟 Key Highlights  
🎵 Real drum sounds for each key/button  
🖱️ Clickable and responsive button interface  
💻 Lightweight and fast-performing  
🔊 Uses JavaScript's Audio object for sound  
🎯 Ideal for beginners learning events and DOM manipulation
